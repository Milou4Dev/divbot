Why is this GitHub repository necessary for the proper functioning of the "Divbot" bot?

Unlike most Discord bots, "Divbot" uses an extremely complex but very fast programming language. To avoid data loss or slowdowns, we rely on GitHub.com for the import and management of our commands, since open source "discordgo" bots are extremely rare. Therefore, I have decided to make the commands open source.
